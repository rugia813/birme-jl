forked from https://github.com/livelifebythecode/birme-sd-variant

## Intro
This is a modified version of the site birme.net, I added some functionalities for my own requirement when training stable diffusion models.

## Added Features

### Duplicate & scale crop region
sometimes an image may contain multiple regions that are bigger than 512x512 and are usable for training, it is not easy to crop them in birme.
In this version you can duplicate an image, and crop smaller areas.

### Manual captioning
when training with small set of data, I would prefer manually caption individual images, you can do that easily in this version.
